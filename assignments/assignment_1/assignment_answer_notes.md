notes for assignment answers: 

* Which pair of dimensions most strongly separates high- and low-Prob stars? **Choose exactly one: RA–Dec, Parallax–pmRA, pmRA–pmDE**
* Which dimension contributes least to separation? **Choose exactly one: RA, Dec, Parallax, pmRA, pmDE**
* Which statement matches best the evidence in your plots?
    1. The algorithm primarily exploits spatial clustering (i.e. in position)
    2. The algorithm primarily exploits kinematic coherence (i.e. in stellar motion)
    3. The separation is weak and likely noise-dominated.

### Cluster NGC_6402: 
i. I would say that parallax-pmDE most strongly separates high- and low-prob stars
ii. either RAdeg or DEdeg contributes the least to separation
iii. The algorithm primarily exploits kinematic coherence (i.e. stellar motion)

### Cluster NGC_1039: 
i.
